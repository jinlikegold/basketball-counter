## Basketball Counter

This is my first solo project from Scrimba's Javascript module. I coded this from scratch using a Figma design file. It's fully functional, just needs some final CSS tweaking for alignment. Once I have finished coding it to the specs of the design given, I may update the colors and design as well.
